Thank Phex that you have gathered here,

the general idea of this application is to create a simple way to organize the various modifiers for ranged combat in The Dark Eye 5. 
We want to create a calculator that is fed with the values of the weapon and calculates the correct ranged combat values with the selected modifiers.

May Phex's luck be with you!
